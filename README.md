vsop87.js
=========

This is a library to use the VSOP87 theorem to calculate positions of
planets in the Solar System relative to the Sun.

The library depends on the VSOP87 C series (Heliocentric ecliptic
rectangular coordinates for the equinox of the day).

This library is optimized for readability and simplicity, not speed
or size, as I was unable to find a simple JavaScript example for the
handling of VSOP87 series and wanted to share it.
